# AI_vs_Human_Connect-4
This repository consists of a GUI based connect-4 game which will have a AI (implemented using minimax algorithm) 
playing against a human player.

This is built in continuation to my project which was a GUI connect-4 game. For implementing this AI vs Human connect-4 game, I 
have used minimax algorithm which helps the AI to look into the future and find the best possible moves. Based on the depth to
which it performs its search, the results get better.
